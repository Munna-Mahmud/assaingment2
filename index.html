            <h4>Copa America History</h4>
            <p>Alternative Title: South American Championship of Nations
                Copa América, (Spanish: America Cup) formerly (until 1975) South American Championship of Nations,
                quadrennial South American football (soccer) tournament that is the continent’s premier competition in
                that sport. The Copa América is the world’s oldest international football tournament.
                             The event was first held in 1916 in honour of the 100th anniversary of Argentina’s independence—with
                Uruguay winning the inaugural title. It took place every one to four years before it adopted its current
                quadrennial format in 2007. The Copa América is governed by the Confederación Sudamericana de Fútbol
                (commonly known as CONMEBOL), and the tournament’s field consists of the 10 national teams that are
                members of CONMEBOL—Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and
                Venezuela—plus two additional national teams that are invited to participate in the event.
            </p>
            <p>History
                From an historical perspective, there is an obvious lack of in continuity of the competition marked by
                several irregularities and a few larger gaps between tournaments. Between 1929 and 1935 due to the
                antagonism between the leading football nation on the continent Argentina and Uruguay that arose after
                the World Cup final in 1930, no competitions were played. Between 1967 and 1975, partly due the
                emergency of the Copa Libertadores that was founded in 1960, there was another hiatus.

                After the eight-year break, the tournament was renamed from Campeonato Sudamericano to Copa América and
                a home-and-away format was introduced.

                From 1975 to 1987 the tournament included nine teams in a three-groups structure. In 1991 all ten
                Conmebol members were included in a two-group structure. In 1993, the tournament was expanding to twelve
                teams and since then other nations has been invited to fill up the 12-team structure. Mexico has
                participated regularly since 1993, and besides Mexico, Costa Rica, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Japan,
                Mexico, Panama, Qatar, United States has been participated in Copa América. Among the non-original
                nations, none have so far won the tournament; Mexico have been closest with two second places.

                In 2016, the competition was for the first time held outside South America with USA as hosts. This
                coincided with the 100th year anniversary of the Copa América.</p>
